High energy photon-photon interactions at the LHeC: Exclusive production of pairs of leptons, W and Z bosons as well as
pairs of charged supersymmetric particles. 


This repository provides the elastic and inelastic luminosity spectrum $S_{\gamma\gamma}$ at the LHeC calculated 
using the Equivalent Photon Approximation} (EPA) approach. 


This repository also provides cross-section calculations for several Exclusive productions such as leptons pairs, W and Z bosons as well as
pairs of charged supersymmetric particles production via photon-photon interaction at the LHeC.
